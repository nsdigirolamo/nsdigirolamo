## Past Projects:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Nick's Ray Tracer](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/nicks-ray-tracer) | A ray tracer made following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. This is a second, more serious attempt at this series. My first attempt is [here](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend).|
| [PowerPortals](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/PowerPortals) | A lightweight Spigot plugin for Minecraft that adds interconnected portals. The first "big" project of mine that wasn't for some kind of academic grade.|
| [Unit Circle Toy](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/pygame-unit-circle) | A single-file unit circle toy written in python with pygame. Helps to visualize the relationship between a unit circle and different trigonometric functions.|
| [Software Renderer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLVnrsqx9yo) | A realtime software renderer written in Rust. It's incomplete and untested, but it (barely) works. I managed to import a wireframe of the Utah teapot and recorded a video of it that you can watch via the link. |
