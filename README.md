## Repositories:

I have a lot of repositories, here are a few of my favorites:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [My Website](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/nsdigirolamo.github.io) | My website, hosted on GitHub pages! Made with Hugo, a static site generator. |
| [Nick's Ray Tracing Playground](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-playground) | A ray tracer I made following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. You can find a blog post I made about this project [here](https://www.nsdigirolamo.com/posts/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend/). |
| [Rust Software Renderer](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/rust-software-renderer) | A realtime software renderer written in Rust. It's incomplete and untested, but it (barely) works. I managed to import a wireframe of the Utah teapot and recorded a video of it that you can watch via [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLVnrsqx9yo). |
| [PowerPortals](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/PowerPortals) | A lightweight Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.18/1.19 that adds interconnected portals. Outdated now, but it was the first "big" project of mine that wasn't for some kind of academic grade. You can find its SpigotMC page [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/powerportals.101798/) |
