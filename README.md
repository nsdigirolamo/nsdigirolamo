## ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Delaware with a 
concentration in Systems and Networks. Currently looking forward to a summer
intership with M&T Bank. 

I'm also occasionally working on personal projects to help fill in my gaps of
knowledge. Right now, my goals are to get more comfortable working on the command
line and working with lower-level languages like C and Rust. 

#### Projects:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Nick's Ray Tracer](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/nicks-ray-tracer) | A ray tracer made following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. This is a second, more serious attempt at this series. My first attempt is [here](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend).|
| [PowerPortals](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/PowerPortals) | A lightweight Spigot plugin for Minecraft that adds interconnected portals. The first big project of mine that wasn't for some kind of academic grade.|
| [Unit Circle Toy](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/pygame-unit-circle) | A single-file unit circle toy written in python with pygame. Helps to visualize the relationship between a unit circle and different trigonometric functions.|
