## ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Delaware with a 
concentration in Systems and Networks. Currently looking forward to a summer
intership with M&T Bank. 

I'm also occasionally working on personal projects to help fill in my gaps of
knowledge. Right now, my goals are to get more comfortable working on the command
line and working with lower-level languages like C and Rust.
