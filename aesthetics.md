# Aesthetics

I'm currently running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with a pretty vanilla
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop environment. Here are some ways I like
to customize my experience:

- Cursor: [Bibata Cursor](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor) (specifically the _Ice_ variant)
- Desktop Icons: [MoreWaita](https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita)
- Terminal Emulator: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- Favorite Coding Font: [DejaVu Mono](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)

And here are the GNOME extensions I use:

- [AppIndicator/KStatusNotifierItem support for GNOME Shell](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator)
- [Blur my Shell](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator)
